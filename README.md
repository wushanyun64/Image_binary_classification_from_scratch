# Deep neural network for image binary classification

### Intro
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a project following the instruction from a deep learning online course Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Andrew Ng. We built a L layer ANN framework from scratch by implementing the forward and backward propagation as well as supportive functionalities such as image resize and crop, L2 normalization. 

### Datasets
------------------------------------------------------------------
The framework was applied to train two models for two different datasets:

1. An images dataset consist of different kinds of street foods were labeled as "Hotdog" or "Not Hotdog". This dataset was inspired by the famous TV show Silicon Valley. [1]

2. The original "Cat or Not Cat" dataset used in Andrew Ng's class.
